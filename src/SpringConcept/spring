Bean -> bean is just a java object that Spring manages for you

Spring Container (IoC Container):-
    is the brain of Spring. it's responsible for :
        -> Creating all beans
        -> injecting their dependencies
        -> managing their lifecycle

Inversion of Control (IoC)
    Normally, your code controls when and how objects are created.
    With Spring, you give up that control â€” Spring takes over and creates
    objects for you.

ApplicationContext;-
    This is the main Spring container implementation.
    It knows every bean, manages them, and resolves dependencies.
